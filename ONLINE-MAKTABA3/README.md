Online Maktaba: An Open Educational Resource Library for Kenya's Secondary Schools

Project Name: Online Maktaba

Introduction:

Online Maktaba is a non-profit, open-source platform designed to provide equitable access to learning resources for secondary school students in Kenya. We believe that every student, regardless of their region, time zone, or school affiliation, deserves the opportunity to learn and achieve their full potential. Through our platform, we offer a diverse collection of educational materials, including textbooks, revision guides, practice papers, and multimedia content, all curated and aligned with the Kenyan curriculum.
